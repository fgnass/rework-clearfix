## rework-clearfix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/rework-clearfix.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/rework-clearfix)

[Rework](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework) plugin that adds support for
`clear: fix` which will expand to the
[micro clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) hack:

### Example

```css
.foo {
  clear: fix;
}
```

Yields:

```css
.foo {
  *zoom: 1;
}

.foo:before,
.foo:after {
  content: " ";
  display: table;
}

.foo:after {
  clear: both;
}
```

### Usage

```js
  var rework = require('rework');
  var clearfix = require('rework-clearfix');

  rework(css).use(clearfix);
```
